## AIM: 
To understand the standard procedure to interface an FPGA board and flashing method using usb blaster 

## EQUIPMENT'S REQUIRED:
HARDWARE REQUIRED:  â€“ PC, Cyclone II , USB flasher
SOFTWARE REQUIRED:   Quartus prime

## THEORY 
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.

## PROCEDURE:
Start the Quartus II Programmer.
